# Deep-Learning-for-Predicting-the-Start-and-End-of-Human-Steps-from-Multi-Sensor-Data.

We are submitting 3 approaches in 3 different notebooks. Because we followed 3 different data preprocessing procedures for the models.

`Approach_1(IPYNB).ipynb` is for Multi-layer Perceptron Network.
`Approach_2(IPYNB).ipynb` is for LSTM with Fragmentation.
`Approach_3(IPYNB).ipynb` is for LSTM with Fourier transformation and filtration.
